<!-- WHY TO VISIT CHENNAI-->
    <section id="wvc" class="visit-chennai">
        <h1>Top 5 reasons to visit Chennai</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>Its Cultural Heritage</h3>
              <p>Chennai is the cultural capital of southern India and the birthplace of Carnatic music. Visit in December for the Chennai Music Season, a month-long celebration of classical music and dance, or catch events all year round at the Music Academy and Kalakshetra Foundation.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <h3>The Beaches</h3>
              <p>At 7.5 miles, Marina Beach is the second longest stretch of municipal beachfront in the world, and it's a wonderful place to enjoy a sunset or sunrise. Edward Elliot's Beach is just south of Marina and has a party atmosphere by night, while quieter Breezy Beach is popular with families and tourists.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <h3>Chennai's Churches</h3>
              <p>Colonial settlers built their own churches in Chennai, such as St. Mary's Church, which was Asia's first Anglican church and all that remains of the Fort St. George. Many of the city's oldest churches were built by the Portuguese, including the 16th-century Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Thomas - one of just three churches in the world to be erected on the site of a prophet's tomb. Other noteworthy churches are St. Thomas Mount, St. Matthias Church, and the 107-year-old Tamil Baptist Church in Kilpauk.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <h3>Nature and Wildlife</h3>
              <p>Guindy National Park is the smallest national park in the country and the only one that's in the center of a city. See Indian antelope, elephant, pangolin, and many other species in their natural habitat, or pop next door to Guindy Snake Park to see King cobra, vipers, and Indian rock python.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li>
              <h3>The Shopping</h3>
              <p>Whether you prefer local markets or glitzy malls, specialty shops or stores that sell the finest silks and saris, you can find them in Chennai. Try Egmore for upscale clothing stores or visit the Burma Bazaar in George Town for the pure mulberry silk of Tamil Nadu.</p>

       <p>Chennai can be incredibly hot with temperatures soaring to 113 degrees Fahrenheit in the middle of summer (March to October). However, thanks to its high rainfall and proximity to the coast, the city is pleasant and enjoyable for most of the year. That said, November to February is widely considered to be the best time for a vacation in Chennai. Temperatures are a little lower and you can catch events like the traditional Chennai Music Season and the Pongal Harvest Festival.</p>

<!--Getting Around-->

    <section id="gta" class="get-around">

<h1>How To Get Around Chennai</h1>
    
<h4>Public Transportation</h4>
<p>The city has an extensive public transportation system of buses, overland trains, and a new subway. Buses, operated by Metropolitan Transport Corporation, can be crowded at busy times but they're a cheap and convenient way to get around the city. They cover over 622 routes each day and tourists can purchase daily or weekly passes for ₹50 or ₹300.</p>

<h4>Taxi</h4>
<p>Pre-paid taxis and minicabs can be found near all major tourist attractions and a five-mile journey typically costs ₹157 during the week. Auto-rickshaws are a cheaper alternative but be sure to check that the meter is working before you board. Fares start at ₹24 for the first 1.1 miles and then ₹12 for each additional 0.62 miles.</p>

<h4>Car</h4>
<p>Driving in Chennai can be difficult for visitors who don't understand the complex rules for using the city's busy roads. If you would like to rent a car, you can do so at the airport or in the city (companies include Spice Car Rental and Chennai car Travels) for ₹499 per day, but it's well worth considering a local driver. Rates are ₹250 for a four-hour shift.</p>
